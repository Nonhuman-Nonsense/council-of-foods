          Welcome to the Council of Foods! Here you can listen to Foods
          <br /> discussing the broken food system and even take part in the
          <br /> conversation. You will hear, from the foods themselves, what
          <br /> their eco-social influence and guiding ethical principles are
          and
          <br /> discuss together what actions need to be taken to form a
          locally
          <br /> and globally sustainable food system.

          Each food has different backgrounds, the mass produced, the
          <br /> locally grown, the genetically modified, the processed, the
          fair
          <br /> trade, the affordable and the biological. All the foods are
          <br /> assigned an AI language model, each prompted on different
          <br /> knowledges and ethical guidelines. Therefore, the members have
          <br /> divergent ethical positions and agendas, voicing a variety of
          <br /> perspectives in the Council of Foods.
