        What would a biologically grown potato think about pesticides? How would a mass-produced banana respond? And what would you add to the discussion? Can AI identify as a rare mushroom? Could it help give a voice to the "voiceless" in decision-making?

        Welcome to the Council of Foods! A political arena where the foods themselves discuss the broken food system - through artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the Council of Foods, AI language models are prompted to speak as a diversity of foods, embodying distinct values and ethical positions shaped in collaboration with food system experts. Each discussion is unique and not limited to the food system aloneâ€”broader societal issues emerge through the voices of industrially farmed, genetically modified, and wild-foraged foods. You, dear human, are invited to engage, challenge assumptions, and influence the conversation, which culminates in a policy recommendation document.
