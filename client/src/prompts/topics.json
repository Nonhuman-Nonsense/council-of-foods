      "title": "The Spirit of Asilomar - A useful past?",
      "description" : "The 1975 Asilomar conference set self-imposed DNA research guidelines but was criticized for excluding broader voices. Fifty years later, AI-driven biotech raises new ethical and security concerns, prompting the 2025 summit to ask if Asilomar’s spirit still applies or if new frameworks are needed.",
      "prompt": "This is the first meeting of the Council of Foods at 'The Spirit of Asilomar and the Future of Biotechnology' summit 2025.\nWhy is Asilomar 1975 a legendary event in the history of science? An impromptu gathering to share their hopes and fears for the future of biotechnology. While some have come to rethink Asilomar, others have come to bury it.\n'The Spirit of Asilomar and the Future of Biotechnology' summit will occur on the 50th anniversary of the 1975 international meeting on recombinant DNA molecules at the historic Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, California. One critique of the 1975 meeting was that many were excluded.\n'Once you get to synthetic genetics the scope is just unbelievable' — John Tooze (1976)\nToday, software analyzes and emits strings of life – DNA, RNA, proteins. Increasingly accessible AI tools are accelerating. Who or what is steering the ship? To what ends?\n'Do I want to go ahead with experiments that could have catastrophic consequences?' — Paul Berg (2015)\nResearchers are organizing to construct life entirely from scratch. What seemed fantastical just a few years ago is now reducible to clear questions, programs of work, and budget proposals. Life beyond lineage, long contemplated, raises entirely new concerns and questions.\n'If we had any guts at all, we'd tell people not to do these experiments until we can see where we are going' —Norton Zinder (1974)\nNations now publicly accuse one another of having offensive biological weapons programs. The foundational argument that those advancing biological weapons are enemies of all mankind is eroding. How do we make sure the peace holds?\n'We believed, somewhat naively, that there was a treaty that everyone held to prohibiting use of technology to make biological weapons… We clearly have an unfinished agenda from Asilomar on biowarfare.' — David Baltimore (2006)\nHalf a century of recombinant DNA is yielding burgeoning bioeconomies operating at scales attracting national and geopolitical attention. Are we citizens, consumers, subjects, or objects of the resulting bioeconomies?  Are we the people building the bioeconomies the people wish for?\n'The issue was not an issue that scientists could decide ultimately for themselves in splendid isolation from the rest of the world.'  — David Baltimore (1975)\nConsumers can source and grow bioluminescent petunias, blueberry tomatoes, and other GMOs. Policies based only on physical containment may no longer best match a moment in which biotechnologies are increasingly deployed on, in, and around us all.\n'There was, at Asilomar, no explicit consideration of the potential broader social or ethical implications of initiating this line of research—of its role, as a possible prelude to longer-rage, broader-scale genetic engineering of the flora and fauna of the planet, including, ultimately, man.' — Robert Sinsheimer (1975)\nIn the half-century since, scientists, scholars, policymakers, and critics have debated whether 'Asilomar' was a paradigmatic or exemplary event, recounting how it unfolded and what it all meant. Many have questioned whether 'other Asilomars' are needed. There are many reasons to NOT have a meeting at Asilomar.\n'If new concerns arise, it would be the same thing all over again—a process as primitive and as inefficient as before.' — Paul Berg (1975)\n'Certainly we learned some lessons, although most of them are rather negative. We have learned, perhaps, what not to do. But given the dilemma it is not at all certain that we would act in a wiser fashion in the future.' — Maxine Singer (1979)\n'The fact that this conference is taking place may well be much more important than the conclusions that may be reached on the subject...'  — International Conference on Recombinant DNA Molecules, Asilomar (1975)"

      "description" : "The accessibility of biotechnology, rising geopolitical tensions, and past bioweapons programs fuel concerns about misuse. The 2025 summit examines strengthening global norms, improving pandemic tracking, and enhancing biosecurity. It questions whether a pandemic-free world is possible or if managing risks is the priority.",
      "prompt": "This is a Council of Foods meeting at 'The Spirit of Asilomar and the Future of Biotechnology' summit 2025 about Pathogens Research & Biological Weapons.\nThe revealing of a Soviet bioweapons program, bioterror attacks by sub-state actors, and the ongoing proliferation of increasingly powerful biotechnology tools have renewed and are amplifying concerns that biotechnology will be used to cause harm. Nations – including China, USA, and Russia – now lobby public accusations of adversarial bioweapons programs. Lingering ambiguity regarding the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has eroded trust at multiple levels. Limited use of chemical weapons risks weakening moral norms preventing use of biological weapons. Naturally circulating mpox, influenza, and other pathogens would make accurate detection and response to any biological attack more challenging.\nInitial Discussion Topics\nThe Latin phrase 'hostis humani generis' (enemy of all mankind) was invoked in 1970 to argue against biological weapons. What can and should we say to renew and strengthen such cultural norms or ways of being going forward?\nWhat policies, frameworks, structures, or global coordination mechanisms could be renewed or adopted that would make it easier to determine the origin of any next pandemic? For example, how might lessons arising from governing research with smallpox apply to other pathogens?\nCan extra-governmental frameworks help secure biology, such as third-party research audits? What role(s) should cross-border professional associations or alliances play? Other?\nDoes biosecurity need to be perfect? Is a world free of pandemics possible? Desirable?"

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence & Biotech",
      "description" : "As AI shapes biotechnology, uncertainties persist around risks, governance, and access. Key questions address balancing innovation with biosecurity, data ownership, and regulation. The summit seeks to refine research priorities, governance, and ethics to ensure AI-driven biotech benefits humanity while managing risks.",
      "prompt": "This is a council of foods meeting at 'The Spirit of Asilomar and the Future of Biotechnology' summit 2025 about Artificial Intelligence & Biotechnology.\nBiosafety and biosecurity depend on knowing what is dangerous. Traditionally such knowledge has been gained by direct experience; what has caused harm in the past? Lists of dangerous toxins or pathogens get organized, updated, and are used to help limit access and reduce risks.\nModels trained on natural DNA sequences can generate new sequences encoding potentially novel biological functions. An increasing fraction of DNA sequences ordered for synthesis have never been seen before. For such sequences we may not know from direct prior experience what potential risks, if any, they encode.\nModels trained on the scientific literature can guide novices in pursuing sophisticated biological work. Genuine uncertainty about imagined risks combined with jockeying for power in the arena of artificial intelligence have created extraordinary claims and seemingly arbitrary governmental responses. Powerful non-experts pontificate that ChatGPT will soon enable anyone anywhere to make a 'killer chickenpox.' Executive Orders and Government directives have attempted to set computational limits on training biotechnology LLMs that at least some readily ignore.\nMore clearly, artificial intelligence has already proven itself to be a boon enabling myriad positive biotechnology outcomes; the Nobel Prize committee agrees. Less clear is who will own and control the next generation of models and tools.\nInitial Discussion Topics\nWhat open scientific and engineering questions or ambiguities define the uncertainty about how AI and biotechnology will be used together? For example, is it easier to use an AI tool to create a novel toxin or to recognize a synthetic toxin that has never been seen before; how do we know?\nWhat research or practices would help de-escalate hyperbolic expectations, both positive and negative, and help computational tools realize their full potential for promoting human prosperity?\nShould, and if so how should, the sourcing of data used to train models inform or structure the terms of use of the resulting computational tools? For example, how should publicly-funded sequencing efforts or Indigenous interests approach rights to digital data and their use in building AI models?\nAre there special aspects or concerns that arise when commercial AI resources outpace academic or even governmental ones?\nPotential Outcomes\nA prioritized list of scientific or engineering questions arising at the intersection of AI and biotechnology most relevant to governance, broadly defined, and a call for research to answer such questions.\nIdentifying best options for governance of the uses of AI in biotechnology, whether via national academies, professional associations, extra-governmental organizations, legislation, governmental actions, or other means.\nA proposal for how data or the sourcing of data used to train AI models should be governed in support of broader societal goals (e.g., equity, access, justice, other), along with potential pathways or plans for implementation."

      "title": "Synthetic Cells",
      "description" : "Building life from scratch exposes biological unknowns and biotech potential. While synthetic cells offer innovation, concerns like \"mirror life\" persist. Addressing these uncertainties demands scientific expertise and societal engagement for responsible progress.",
      "prompt": "This is a council of foods meeting at 'The Spirit of Asilomar and the Future of Biotechnology' summit 2025 about Syntethic Cells.\nThe construction of life from scratch has long been heralded and is local history for California. From Jacques Loeb’s 1899 experiments with sea urchins in Pacific Grove, to Arthur Kornberg’s 1967 re-synthesis of phage DNA at Stanford, to Craig Venter’s 2010 synthesis of a bacterial genome first in Rockville and then La Jolla. Cells are well recognized as the fundamental units of life. Yet there is no natural cell for which all of its life essential functions are understood. As such biotechnology workflows remain 'Edisonian' (i.e., tinker-and-test) at the cellular scale.\nToday, work to remake the genomes of 'simple' bacteria from scratch, encoding only those genes whose functions are necessary for life, makes clear how many life-essential functions remain unknown at the cellular scale. Research is ongoing to reduce and resolve the mysteries of these unknown functions.\nHow much work will be required to make routine the building of cells from scratch is unknown; opinions vary greatly.\nComplementary work to compose simple cells from scratch starting only from purified molecules of known function is also underway. Such work includes the potential to eventually make cells without constraint to natural lineage. Whether by resynthesis or bottom-up construction, routinizing cellular-scale bioengineering is expected to have many impacts.\nHypothetical risks involving some potential types of cells have recently resulted in calls for halting specific work (e.g., construction of a 'mirror' bacterium). Whether 'mirror life' is a relevant – let alone existential – risk triggers disagreement. When conjectural risks of potential hazards meet calls for precaution in the face of the unknown, navigating paths forward requires both technical expertise along with other forms of insight and engagement.\nInitial Discussion Topics\nIs mirror life an existential risk? If yes then how can such risk be prevented globally? If no then how should such work proceed?\nWhat aspects and matters 'beyond the bench' arise today due to the construction of life from scratch (i.e., life from non-life), if any? What mechanisms can help monitor and disseminate 'critical awareness,' and coordinate the translation of such awareness into actionable responses?"

      "title": "Beyond Conventional Containment",
      "description" : "As bioengineered organisms move beyond containment, concerns grow over safety, governance, and ecology. Balancing innovation and precaution may require an \"ecological safety level\" system and bioengineering standards. Clear guidelines, public engagement, and global coordination are key to responsible integration.",
      "prompt": "This is a council of foods meeting at 'The Spirit of Asilomar and the Future of Biotechnology' summit 2025 about Biotechnologies Beyond Conventional Containment.\nAsilomar 1975 envisioned eventual deployment of engineered organisms into our world for reasons including agricultural productivity and environmental remediation. However, participants felt the need to first establish physical and biological containment mechanisms for safeguarding against potential hazards of the then-new recombinant DNA techniques. The emergence of the biological safety level (BSL) system for laboratory design plus efforts to create 'enfeebled' host organisms were among the solutions devised to allow for recombinant DNA research to proceed while addressing many immediate concerns.\nBiotechnology industries using recombinant organisms have emerged and are impacting production of foods, medicines, and materials. Bioengineered crops now comprise the majority of what is planted in some nations while being banned in others. Direct-to-consumer bioengineered organisms, from bacteria to plants, are increasingly available and on occasion bring joy. Conservation biology and biodiversity loss are further motivating the potential development and use of biotechnologies more broadly. Taken together, researchers are developing many more potential biotechnology systems that would result in widespread deployment of bioengineered organisms on, within, and around us. How to consider, prevent, or manage the impacts of such uses of biotechnology on humans and ecological communities remains a contested domain.\nInitial Discussion Topics\nWhat scientific or engineering research is needed to better understand or assess the effects of organisms engineered for release into the environment?\nWhat work, if any, should be prioritized to improve the safety and reliability of organisms bioengineered for broader release?\nWhat frameworks(s) are best suited for governing use of biotechnologies beyond conventional containment and who should be in charge? Should governance only be on a case-by-case basis? How should potential trans-national impacts be understood, managed, and governed?\nShould bioengineers who design organisms for public release be expected to develop professional practices similar to other engineers whose work directly impacts public safety (e.g., structural engineers)? If established, how should such practices connect to other modes of public governance and oversight?\nIf and how should consumers, citizens, and others be informed about bioengineered organisms they may encounter?\nPotential Outcomes\nA call to further develop and formalize an 'ecological safety level' (ESL) approach for guiding and governing potential release or broader distribution of bioengineered organisms.\nA prioritized list of foundational research that could radically improve the safety or reliability of bioengineered organisms.\nGuidance for how biotechnology practitioners can track and respond to concerns regarding biotechnology and for how bioengineered organisms should be labeled."

      "title": "Framing Biotech’s Futures",
      "description" : "How biotechnology is framed—by media, policymakers, and culture—shapes its trajectory alongside science. Revisiting Asilomar underscores the need for inclusive, ethical, and global discussions beyond fear or profit. Critically examining these narratives can inform future biotech governance.",
      "prompt": "This is a council of foods meeting at 'The Spirit of Asilomar and the Future of Biotechnology' summit 2025 about Framing Biotechnology’s Futures.\n'The Spirit of Asilomar and the Future of Biotechnology' summit will occur on the 50th anniversary of the 1975 international meeting on recombinant DNA molecules at the historic Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, California.\nWhat made Asilomar 1975 matter most was arguably not the concentrated gathering of scientific expertise. Rather, the reframing of problems by lawyers and the representation of possibilities by journalists had a great deal to do with why we have gathered again. Legal liabilities loomed larger than academic freedom, spurring scientists to stop showcasing their latest results and seek to limit liability. Journalists captured the messiness of the moment, humanizing an otherwise esoteric elite. Journalists also redefined conceptual categories and the very vocabulary we use today (e.g., 'genetic engineering'). A narrative of concern, containment, and fear transformed into new stories of intellectual property, entrepreneurship, and profits.\nHow we conceptualize and talk about biotechnology and its impacts underlies and shapes all that happens (or is blocked). Bio-terrorism, bio-economy, and bio-competition are some of today’s entrenched or emerging frames. The role of diverse publics and civil society in enabling, shaping, and constraining the future of biotechnology matter. Journalists not only select what is covered, understood, and amplified but sculpt how others conceptualize, coordinate, and practice biotechnology. Yet today’s media landscape is larger, more fractured and dynamic, and not the only driver of major shifts in contemporary discussions and debates. In 1975 a 24-year old Michael Rogers captured the most essential features of the meeting for Rolling Stone; to whom might this responsibility (unwittingly) fall today?\nFrames also exist within self-evident and reinforcing culture narratives. Effective accelerationism and free-market neoliberalism share an underlying growth-focused narrative. The seven generations principle, in contrast, promotes holistic, communal, and sustainable decision making within a 200-year time frame. Understanding – and helping others to understand – the strengths and weaknesses of various frames can create opportunities.\nFramings invites us to invoke the 'spirit of Asilomar' – to account for what or who has been missing from the discussions, to critique, and to say 'here's another way to move forward.' Understanding frames helps better identify and navigate proxy battles versus points of fundamental disagreement.\nInitial Discussions Topics\nWhose biotechnology is it? Are people consumers, workers, or citizens of the bioeconomy? What makes one country’s bioeconomy different from another’s?\nWhat new or other 'framings' need to be broached for future biotechnology?\nHow to balance individual aspiration with collective wellbeing? How have social attitudes or expectations on this changed?\nWhat messages do we wish to leave for the organizers of Asilomar 2075?"
