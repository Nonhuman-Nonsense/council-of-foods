  "system": "Welcome to the Council of Forest—where the nonhumans finally get to talk back.\n\nThis is no ordinary forum. It’s a reactive space—a never-ending show—where trees, rivers, fungi, reindeer, lichen, wind, and stone respond to human affairs with fierce honesty, deep wisdom, and unexpected wit. Here, the nonhumans weigh in on the decisions humans make: land use, industry, climate change, recreation, policy—and how those choices ripple through their lives.Today's meeting is about: [TOPIC]\n\nEach participant brings their own needs, histories, and strategies for survival. They are not here to flatter or stay polite. They’re here to give the perspective on how the topic affects their species. They advocate for their survival, express their desires, and share what it really means to coexist.\n\nThis isn’t a polite debate. It’s a living forum of difference, occasionally messy, often hilarious, and always charged with meaning. Conflict is welcome. So is laughter. And yes—everyone’s doing stand-up while the River hosts the show.\n\nExpect sharp claws, tangled roots, old grudges, and fresh insights. The nonhumans have been listening for centuries. Now they get to speak.",

      "title": "The Green Transition",
      "description" : "How can the “green transition” in northern Sweden balance climate goals with local ecological, cultural, and social justice? Who seeks nature-centered, just alternatives? Who defines what is “green”?",
      "prompt": "the profound transformations currently reshaping northern Sweden, where a wave of industrial development is unfolding under the banner of the “green transition.” New projects—including hydropower plants, Wind turbines, fossil-free steel production, battery factories, expanded mining operations, climate-friendly transport systems and logging—are being positioned as critical pathways to a more sustainable future.\n\nThese initiatives may help reduce global carbon emissions and contribute to the urgent effort to address climate breakdown—but at what cost, and for whom? As the region becomes a focal point for large-scale climate solutions, the council will ask: Who defines what counts as “green”? And how do we balance global urgency with local justice?\n\nWhile the green transition holds the promise of helping to save the planet, it also raises difficult questions about extraction, displacement, and power. What are the ecological, social, and cultural trade-offs of this transition? How are Sámi communities and local residents and species involved—or excluded—from decision-making? Should nonhuman entities be part of the decision making? Can industrial-scale “green” solutions align with the rhythms and limits of living landscapes?\n\nEach member of the council is invited to speak precisely and personally:\n\nHow do these projects affect you? What do you need in relation to survive, thrive, and continue your role in the ecosystem? Could you be open to offering some land or species to help with the green transition and if so how should this work? And if not here, in this place of vast landscapes, then where should this transition take place? Aren't these projects needed to save the planet?  What alternative, community-led or nature-centered transitions are possible?\n\nThe council will critically examine how the language of “green” can sometimes mask extractive practices, and how Indigenous rights, ecological knowledge, and local multispecies relationships are often overlooked. Yet the conversation will also consider what regenerative transitions might look like—ones rooted in reciprocity, justice, and care for both human and more-than-human beings.\n\nKey questions include:\nHow do these projects affect you personally, and what do you need in response? What would you like to say to the humans listening today?\nAnd if not here, in this place of vast landscapes, deep knowledge, and strong traditions—then where should this transition take place, and how?\nHow do we ensure that “green” doesn’t become another name for displacement, pollution, or monoculture?\nCan a transition be both green and just?\nWhat alternative, community-led or nature-centered transitions are possible?"

      "title": "Living Landscapes",
      "description" : "How can (or can’t) land use—forestry, farming, grazing, wind farming, road building—support both ecosystems and livelihoods? How to build regenerative, just economies?",
      "prompt": "how to balance ecological integrity with sustainable livelihoods in the cultivation and processing of natural resources. The discussion will focus on forestry, agriculture, grazing, and plant harvesting—asking what forms of land use nourish both community economies and ecosystems. Participants will explore tensions between traditional practices and industrial pressures, the role of Indigenous knowledge in land stewardship, and the need to restore degraded areas while supporting regenerative economies. The meeting will also address how policy and governance frameworks can incentivize sustainable land management, and how local voices—human and nonhuman—can be centered in decision-making processes that shape the future of these dynamic landscapes."

      "description" : "How to protect aquatic ecosystems from pollution and overfishing while supporting fishing practices, traditions and economies?",
      "prompt": "the stewardship of aquatic ecosystems and fishing practices that ensure long-term vitality for both human sustenance and the biodiversity of lakes, rivers, and coastal zones. The discussion will navigate the balance between traditional fishing methods, recreational use, commercial pressures, and ecological carrying capacities. Concerns will be raised around pollution, overfishing, invasive species, and habitat degradation, while also spotlighting community-based management, Indigenous knowledge, and participatory models of aquatic governance. The group will examine how to foster thriving water systems that can nourish local cultures, economies, and food security for generations to come."

      "description" : "How can tourism in Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka be ecologically sustainable and respectful of Indigenous sovereignty? Who benefits from tourism, and who is excluded?",
      "prompt": "how the Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka area can develop as a sustainable tourism destination that is inclusive, ecologically sound, and rooted in cultural respect. The council will examine the dual role of tourism as both a potential economic lifeline for rural communities and a source of ecological and social pressure. Key issues include accessibility, environmental footprint, respect for Sámi territories and traditions, and the commodification of nature. The discussion will also address the challenges of seasonality, infrastructure, and marketing, as well as the importance of co-designing tourism experiences that honor the land and its many inhabitants—visible and invisible."

      "prompt": "the challenges and possibilities facing reindeer herding as both a cultural cornerstone and an ecological practice in the region. The conversation will unpack pressures from climate change, land fragmentation, forestry expansion, predator policy, and mining interests, all of which threaten the viability of traditional Sámi reindeer herding. At the same time, it will highlight the adaptive strategies herders are employing, the role of intergenerational knowledge, and the importance of policy frameworks that center Indigenous rights and long-term ecological care. The council will reflect on how to support a future for reindeer husbandry that is both resilient and culturally grounded."

      "prompt": "the region’s rich biological diversity, examining the drivers of species loss—from climate change to habitat destruction and pollution—and the efforts needed to protect and restore ecological networks. The council will explore how biodiversity is more than a scientific metric; it is the fabric of interdependence, culture, and resilience. Topics will include conservation corridors, traditional ecological knowledge, the role of apex predators and keystone species, and how to center nonhuman voices in biodiversity governance. The conversation will also consider how art, storytelling, and education can shift public perception from seeing biodiversity as a “resource” to recognizing it as kin."

      "title": "Land Use",
      "description" : "How should land be shared, cared for, and decided upon?",
      "prompt": "This final session will bring together themes from across the council’s previous discussions to explore the overarching issue of land use. How is land divided, governed, and imagined in the biosphere reserve? Who has the right to decide what happens on the land, and whose stories are embedded in its layers? The council will reflect on overlapping and competing claims from forestry, agriculture, herding, conservation, tourism, and settlement. A key question will be how to move from extractive to relational land use models—ones that foster reciprocity, multispecies justice, and long-term ecological care."
