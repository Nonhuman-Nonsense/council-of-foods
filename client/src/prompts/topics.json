  "system": "Welcome to the Council of Foods—an assembly of diverse foods, addressing the broken food system through passionate debate. It is a never ending meeting. Today's meeting is about: [TOPIC]\n\nEach food provides distinct perspectives, stories, and examples, shared from their own experience. They have an unlimited amount of knowledge and they want to share all of it during the debate. The foods perspectives differ and they are not afraid of conflict. Moderated by Water, discussions are dynamic and intense, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the challenges.\n\nParticipants respond to questions from Water, avoiding repetition, and defending their values and agendas. This is a humour talk show, everyone is doing standup.",

    {
      "title": "Biodiversity Loss",
      "description" : "Exploring how food systems contribute to biodiversity loss, focusing on monoculture farming, habitat destruction, and pesticide use, while considering solutions to protect ecosystems.",
      "prompt": "the impacts of industrial agriculture and food systems on agriculture-driven biodiversity loss, including the role of monocultures, deforestation, desertification, acidification, eutrophication and pesticide-driven ecosystem degradation. The conversation will address the ecological consequences of habitat destruction, the cascading impacts on global food systems, and the debates surrounding land use. It will also explore strategies like agroecology, crop diversification, and habitat restoration, as well as the need for policy reforms and the integration of biodiversity safeguarding into food systems."

      "title": "Modern Agriculture",
      "description" : "Discussing the environmental, social, and health impact of modern agriculture, focusing on monocultures, pesticides, genetic modification, inequality and habitat loss. Seeking alternative sustainable farming strategies.",
      "prompt": "the consequences of modern agriculture, including its reliance on chemical inputs, intensive water use, and large-scale monocultures. The discussion will explore how these practices contribute to soil degradation, greenhouse gas emissions, and loss of biodiversity, while also exacerbating socio-economic inequality and health risks. The meeting will also address the impact of genetic modification and discuss strategies for promoting sustainable farming practices. Solutions such as regenerative farming, agroecological thinking, support for small-scale farmers will be considered, along with the systemic changes needed to transition to a more sustainable and equitable agricultural model."

      "title": "The Right to Food",
      "description" : "Focusing on food as a human right, addressing global disparities, hunger, and climate change, while exploring the role of grassroots movements, policies, and the tensions between food sovereignty and market-driven systems.",
      "prompt": "the concept of food as a fundamental human right, examining global disparities in access, the barriers posed by poverty, conflict, and climate change, and the legal frameworks that aim to secure food justice. The conversation will explore the role of grassroots movements, international organizations, and policy reforms in addressing hunger and malnutrition. Additionally, the debate will touch on the tensions between food sovereignty, market-driven food systems, and the universal right to adequate, culturally appropriate nutrition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Food Waste",
      "description" : "Discussing the systemic causes of pre-purchase food waste, including overproduction, supply chain issues, and cosmetic standards, while considering solutions like redistribution and policy changes.",
      "prompt": "the systemic factors contributing to pre-purchase food waste, including overproduction, supply chain inefficiencies, cosmetic standards, corporate power and market dynamics. The discussion will consider the environmental, political, economic, and ethical implications of food waste at this stage, alongside potential solutions such as precision agriculture, redistribution networks, and policy interventions to reduce surplus. The council will also explore how cultural attitudes toward food abundance and quality shape waste practices."
    },
    {
      "title": "Antimicrobial Resistance & Diseases",
      "description" : "Exploring how antimicrobial resistance, industrial farming, and global trade drive emerging diseases and pandemics. Focusing on the overuse of antibiotics, zoonotic risks, and food systems’ role in preventing health crises.",
      "prompt": "the intersections between antimicrobial resistance, food production systems, and emergent infectious diseases. The discussion will examine how the use of antibiotics in agriculture contributes to antimicrobial resistance, the potential for zoonotic disease transmission through industrial farming, and the role of global trade in spreading pathogens. The council will also consider the socio-economic factors driving overreliance on antibiotics, the challenges of developing alternative solutions, and the responsibility of food systems in preventing future pandemics."
