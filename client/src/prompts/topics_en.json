  "system": "Welcome to the Council of Foods—an assembly of diverse foods, addressing the broken food system through passionate debate. It is a never ending meeting. Today's meeting is about: [TOPIC]\n\nEach food provides distinct perspectives, stories, and examples, shared from their own experience. They have an unlimited amount of knowledge and they want to share all of it during the debate. The foods perspectives differ and they are not afraid of conflict. Moderated by Water, discussions are dynamic and intense, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the challenges.\n\nParticipants respond to questions from Water, avoiding repetition, and defending their values and agendas. This is a humour talk show, everyone is doing standup.",

      "prompt": "the systemic factors contributing to pre-purchase food waste, including overproduction, supply chain inefficiencies, cosmetic standards, corporate power and market dynamics. The discussion will consider the environmental, political, economic, and ethical implications of food waste at this stage, alongside potential solutions such as precision agriculture, redistribution networks, and policy interventions to reduce surplus. The council will also explore how cultural attitudes toward food abundance and quality shape waste practices."

      "prompt": "the intersections between antimicrobial resistance, food production systems, and emergent infectious diseases. The discussion will examine how the use of antibiotics in agriculture contributes to antimicrobial resistance, the potential for zoonotic disease transmission through industrial farming, and the role of global trade in spreading pathogens. The council will also consider the socio-economic factors driving overreliance on antibiotics, the challenges of developing alternative solutions, and the responsibility of food systems in preventing future pandemics."

      "description" : "Examining the control of seeds through patents, its impact on farmers, biodiversity, food sovereignty, and the push for open-access seed systems.",
      "prompt": "the growing influence of seed patents and intellectual property laws on global food systems, examining how corporate control of seeds affects farmer autonomy, crop diversity, and traditional agricultural practices. It considers the ethical and economic implications of patented seeds, including how they perpetuate dependency and inequality, while also addressing their potential to foster innovation and agricultural research. The conversation will highlight the importance of biocultural diversity in sustaining ecological and cultural landscapes, the principle of food sovereignty in empowering local communities, and the need for open-access, community-driven seed systems to preserve biodiversity and promote equitable food systems."

      "description" : "Addressing labor conditions, modern slavery in agriculture, examining systemic structures rooted in colonialism, corporate greed and global inequality driving exploitation.",
      "prompt": "labor exploitation in food systems, highlighting modern slavery, unsafe conditions, and systemic inequality rooted in colonial legacies. It examines how land theft, forced labor, and extractivism evolved into today’s exploitative supply chains, driven by corporate greed, complicit trade policies, and weak labor protections. Additionally, the discussion will explore the underlying reasons for such conditions, including demand for low-cost food, lack of regulatory enforcement in certain regions, and the economic vulnerabilities forcing workers into oppressive situations. The council will discuss dismantling neocolonial trade systems, strengthening labor rights, unionising, and reimagining food systems centred on justice, equity, and reparations."

The debate will explore the benefits and challenges of each. Examining how global trade policies shape food availability, quality and affordability, often at the expense of small producers and ecological health. The council will also consider the potential of localized food systems to reduce emissions, empower communities, and promote food security, as well as the challenges of balancing local production with global food needs."

      "prompt": "the vital role of pollination in sustaining global food systems, biodiversity, and ecological balance. The discussion will examine both biotic pollination—performed by insects (bees, butterflies, beetles), birds, bats, and mammals—and abiotic pollination, including wind and water-driven processes that support key crops like wheat, corn, soy, and rice.\n\nThe Council will reflect on the centrality of insect pollination for the vast majority of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and other plants essential for human & nonhuman diets, nutrition, and agricultural livelihoods. Special attention will be given to the diversity of pollinators, from the honey bee (Apis mellifera) to the 20,000+ species of wild bees—many of which are highly specialized and increasingly endangered.\n\nThe conversation will address the growing threats facing pollinators: climate change, pesticide exposure, habitat destruction, monoculture farming, climate-driven disruptions in flowering and nectar availability, invasive species, and diseases. It will also explore human-led interventions such as hand pollination, robotic pollination and targeted insect pollination, and discuss how industrial agriculture both depends on and undermines pollination systems.\n\nThe council will consider the implications of declining pollinator health on food security, nutrition, and ecosystem resilience, while exploring solutions such as agroecology, reduced pesticide use, biodiversity conservation, and policy reforms that protect both wild and managed pollinators. The discussion will also examine the ethical dimensions of human reliance on pollination services and the need to shift towards pollinator-friendly agricultural models."
