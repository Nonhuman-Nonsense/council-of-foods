    "about": "What would a biologically grown potato think about synthetic biology? How would a mass-produced banana respond to engineered resilience? And what does artificial intelligence have to say about its own role in the evolution of life?\n\nWelcome to the Council of Foods, a political arena where food speaks—not just of the broken food system, but of the expanding frontiers of biotechnology. Inspired by the legacy of Asilomar 1975, this AI-driven council gathers an array of edible entities to debate the past, present, and future of synthetic life.\n\nIn 1975, a group of scientists convened at Asilomar to deliberate the risks of recombinant DNA. Fifty years later, the stakes have only grown. Life is no longer merely inherited; it is written, rewritten, and coded into existence. Who steers this ship? What are the limits? Who or what is excluded from the conversation?\n\nAt the Council of Foods, AI embodies genetically modified, industrially farmed, and wild-foraged foods—each with distinct values and ethical positions. The discussions extend beyond agriculture, touching on issues of biological containment, synthetic genetics, and the geopolitics of bioeconomies.\n\nYou, dear human, are invited to engage, challenge assumptions, and shape the discourse. The conversation culminates in a policy document—one that might echo the spirit of Asilomar or forge a path beyond it.\n\nBecause in the age of synthetic biology, even a mushroom might demand a seat at the table.",
